<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Over-the-top content (OTT) is the term used in the broadcasting and technology business reporting to refer to audio, video, and other media transmitted via the Internet as a standalone product, that is, without a cable operator or direct-broadcast satellite television systems controlling or distributing the content. On a daily basis my company receives catalogs of the TV programs from various OTT providers that must be matched to the programs in the company’s database. The data my company maintains is an industry standard and the matched content is sold back to the customers who rely on it to power their applications. The problem of matching records has been studied under various approaches like de-duplication, record linkage, entity resolution, etc.</p>
</div>
<div id="matching" class="section level2">
<h2>Matching</h2>
<p>We have a database of structured program details which is the single source of truth. Every structured record (s ∈ S) consists of a set of attributes which can be numeric or categorical in nature, like title, runtime, airdate, language, season, and episode number. We receive as input a fairly unstructured program metadata (u) and sometimes with missing data for some of the attributes. We try to find a program from our database that has the highest probability of being a match to the incoming program.</p>
<p>The matcher is trained using a training set, U, which consists of incoming programs that have been matched to one structured record/program. We also have mismatched records from S for every u ∈ U, i.e., the things the incoming program shouldn’t match to. The correct matches are labeled as 1 and the incorrect matches are labeled as 0.</p>
<div id="similarity-feature-vectors" class="section level3">
<h3>Similarity feature vectors</h3>
<p>The similarity between an incoming program and the source program is defined in terms of the similarity values of the attributes present in them. For each pair of (u, s) we generate a similarity feature vector by comparing the attributes of u with the attributes of s and come up with a score between 0 and 1 for each attribute. For comparing string attributes like titles, we use string edit distance. For airdate and runtime we measure how close the two values are. For language, season number and episode number, the score is either 1 if they match exactly or 0 if they don’t match exactly.</p>
<p>The final matching model should be able to provide a probabilistic score of the match between an incoming program and the source program. Further, the model needs to learn the relative importance of the attributes for future modeling work. The logistic regression algorithm seems to satisfy this criteria.</p>
<p>The logistic regression learns to match from the similarity feature vectors to a binary label y, through the binary logistic function. We pair each incoming program with a small number of mismatching programs other than the correct match to introduce variability. Some of the mismatches are totally different and some of them are overlapping, like episodes from different seasons of the same show, for example.</p>
<p>The learned matching model can then find the best match by pairing u with a set of candidates s from S (obtained by a fuzzy search on the database using only titles) and choosing the s that results in the highest score.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="summary-and-future-work" class="section level2">
<h2>Summary and future work</h2>
<p>The proposed solution takes into account matches as well as mismatches between the program attributes and learns to infer relative importance of different attributes in the values. The solution works well when all of the data or attributes expected for a program are present. But more often than we’d like, a lot of data is missing. The system should be taught to treat missing data differently than the mismatching data. This is something we’d like to include in future improvements. In addition, our team will explore some alternate solutions using neural networks rather than regressors.</p>
<p>While the solution proposed here is in the context of TV programs, it applies to any domain where there is an idea of an offer and a repository of structured data. Take for example an e-commerce site trying to sell a laptop. The site gets offers from many vendors and they need to match these offers (?) to their own data in order to show different offers to the customers. In the future, we’d like to test the system with such different domains.</p>
