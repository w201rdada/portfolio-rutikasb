## Climate change is real

The devastation from hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria and the dozens of wildfires that raged across West U.S. have resulted in one of the costliest string of weather events in U.S. history. According to early estimates, over the course of few weeks, the hurricanes and wildfires have left a trail of damage that could add up to nearly $300 billion. The evidence of climate change is undeniable and offsetting your CO2 emissions is a practical and immediate way to take ownership of your personal contribution to climate change. This is where my application/tool will come in.

My tool is for every environmentally cautious person to help them monitor their carbon footprint and reduce it. Small changes from everyone can add up to great benefits.

## How my tool will help

The first step into reducing a person's or a family's carbon footprint will be to learn about their current habits and then make suggestions for improvement in the areas of food habits, energy consumptions, fuel consumption, and reusage and recycling habits.

The current habits of the app user will be monitored for a few weeks and following data will be collected for a person or a family to start with -- size of the family, type and amount of energy they consume, recycling habits, diet types, their main mode of commute, type and number of vehicles they own.

After anaylzing the user's data, personalized suggestions will be made to help reduce their carbon footprint. Some examples of such suggestions:
1. Alternatives to driving -- walk or ride bike to work for a couple of days in a week; Carpool; Switch to low carbon vehicle; Combine errands to make fewer trips.
2. Eat locally-produced and organic food; Cut meat consumption or become a weekday vegetarian.
3. Switch to clean energy sources; be mindful of water and power consumption
4. Reuse and recycle; Make simple changes like carry a reusable grocery bag; Switch to reusable food containers and reusable produce bags.
These are just a few examples and depending on a person's habits, these changes could be personalized.

## Conclusion

There's certainly scope for improvements to this approach. And as part of future work we can get feedback on the changes the users have made to their daily lives and alter the suggestions accordingly. I agree that people may not be able carry out every single suggestion made by the app, but I believe baby steps could be the best way towards reducing emissions and global warming instead of trying to strike a huge bargain among world powers. Incremental steps can make serious progress towards addressing the causes of climate change. And I strongly believe that my tool can help with this cause.
